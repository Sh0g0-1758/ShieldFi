"ShieldFi" is a Proof-of-Concept developed at Internal Hackathon of Blockchain Society-IIT Roorkee. 
ShieldFi at its heart carries the essence which is about securing DeFi Transactions. 
We aim to improvise the connection and collaboration between the Security experts and teams at various DeFi protocols. We aim to do so through the use of Zero-knowledge proofs. 
The core concept behind ShieldFi is simple : Generate a zkP for an exploit in a smart contract and report it to the DeFi teams .

# Problem 
Bug bounty programs in the DeFi space face challenges in terms of management, recognition, and compensation for white hat hackers.
This often discourages hackers from reporting vulnerabilities, posing a risk to the overall security of the DeFi ecosystem.
